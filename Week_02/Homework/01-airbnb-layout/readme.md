# # Week 2 Homework 1 - Airbnb Mockup

Lots of websites, including Facebook and Airbnb, use a grid layout to display common elements, such as information cards, photos, and other information. The best way to learn how to create these different layouts is to try them ourselves.

## Getting Started
* A HTML file (`index.html`) and CSS file (`css/style.css`) have been created for you. Content is also provided in a folder called `img`. 

## Requirements
* Look at the deliverable screenshot and see how well you can match it.
* Keep the following in mind when recreating the screenshot
  * Using the right font
  * Obtaining and using relevant images
  * Aligning the text in the center of each image
  * Aligning the images in the center of each page
  * Thinking of the layout in terms of rows and columns

## Deliverable

Deliver the mockup as close as possible. In addition, code should be well-indented, follow best practices and pass a CSS validator.
